# JACOB'S ANALYTICS PROJECTS

## Project 1: [Social Media Ads Targeting Strategy Analysis](https://github.com/jacobdbt2100/Social-Media-Ads-Targeting-Strategy-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
I analysed social media advertising data to understand how different age groups, genders, and interest segments respond to campaigns. The analysis revealed clear disparities between engagement and conversion performance across demographics. While some groups generated high impressions and clicks, they delivered poor conversions. By identifying high-value and low-value segments, the project outlines audience optimization opportunities to improve targeting efficiency and overall campaign ROI.

## Project 2: [Manufacturing Downtime Analysis](https://github.com/jacobdbt2100/Manufacturing-Downtime-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)

I analysed soda bottling production line data and found that downtime caused 36% inefficiency, extending batch duration by 23 hours. Operator errors were the leading drivers. Five factors–mainly machine adjustments, machine failure, and inventory shortage amongst others–accounted for 80% of total downtime. Base on these findings, I recommended targeted operator training, improved maintenance schedules, real-time inventory tracking, and high-downtime equipment upgrades to boost operational efficiency.
