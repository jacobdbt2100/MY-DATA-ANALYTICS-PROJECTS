# Project 1: [Supply Chain Service Level Tracking Analysis](https://github.com/jacobdbt2100/Supply-Chain-Service-Level-Tracking-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
Over the past six months, the company has **consistently missed SLA targets**, with an average **delivery delay of +0.5 days** and an average **shortfall of 8 units per order line**, reflecting ongoing lead-time variability and inventory gaps. On-Time and In-Full rates remain low at 59% and 52%, and **40% of all orders are delivered late**, confirming a structural service performance issue. Delays are most severe for high-volume customers such as Lotus Mart, Acclaimed Stores, and Cool Blue (≈ +1.5 days), while the Dairy category, which represents 79% of total volume, records the highest shortages (10–14 units per line).

To reverse this trend, the business should **strengthen demand forecasting** and safety-stock settings for high-volume SKUs, **prioritise key accounts** for service recovery, expand capacity in warehousing and dispatch, and implement **account-level SLA monitoring** to drive sustained OTIF improvement.

# Project 2: [Manufacturing Downtime Analysis](https://github.com/jacobdbt2100/Manufacturing-Downtime-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)

Downtime caused **36% inefficiency**, extending batch duration by **23 hours (1,388 minutes)** beyond the planned **41 hours**, increasing delivery risk. Operator-related issues drove downtime **12% higher** than non-operator causes, with **five factors accounting for 80% of total downtime**, three (**Machine adjustment, Batch change, Batch coding**) linked to operator error. Mac’s downtime is mainly driven by batch changes, while other operators struggle more with machine adjustments, leaving Mac’s efficiency slightly below the team average.

I recommend targeted operator training on high-impact error drivers, focused coaching for Mac on batch changes, strengthened preventive maintenance for high-downtime equipment, and real-time tracking to protect delivery schedules and stock levels.

# Project 3: [Marketing Campaign Effectiveness Analysis](https://github.com/jacobdbt2100/Marketing-Campaign-Effectiveness-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
The campaign delivered strong overall performance, achieving a **ROAS of 4.0, CTR of 9.8%**, and a **conversion rate of 4.5%**, driven by high efficiency in **Search Engine and Social Media** channels and leading returns from the **Eastern region**. However, regional funnel imbalances persist, with the **South** showing high engagement but weak conversion and the **North** converting efficiently despite lower reach. Revenue performance also showed a **sharp decline between April and June 2024** before recovering in July, while revenue remains heavily concentrated in **Product C**, particularly across North, West, and East.

Based on these findings, I recommend **scaling spend selectively** toward top-performing channels, regions, and products; **rebalancing regional strategies** to address funnel inefficiencies; and **reviewing the April–June period** to prevent future revenue declines and strengthen campaign stability.
