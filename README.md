# JACOB'S ANALYTICS PROJECTS

## Project 1: [Marketing Campaign Effectiveness Analysis](https://github.com/jacobdbt2100/Marketing-Campaign-Effectiveness-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
The campaign delivered strong overall performance, achieving a **ROAS of 4.0, CTR of 9.8%**, and a **conversion rate of 4.5%**, driven by high efficiency in **Search Engine and Social Media** channels and leading returns from the **Eastern region**. However, regional funnel imbalances persist, with the **South** showing high engagement but weak conversion and the **North** converting efficiently despite lower reach. Revenue performance also showed a **sharp decline between April and June 2024** before recovering in July, while revenue remains heavily concentrated in **Product C**, particularly across North, West, and East.

Based on these findings, I recommend **scaling spend selectively** toward top-performing channels, regions, and products; **rebalancing regional strategies** to address funnel inefficiencies; and **reviewing the April–June period**

## Project 3: [Supply Chain Service Level Tracking Analysis](https://github.com/jacobdbt2100/Supply-Chain-Service-Level-Tracking-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
On-Time and In-Full service levels were consistently less than targets with at least 23% shortfall over a period of six months. "Delivered" quantity fall short of "Orders" by 400,000. Three customers out of the top 5 having over one million order quantity representing ___% of total order quantity were conspicuously underserved with On_Time delivery as down to 28%. Other customers had less than 800,000 order quantity.

Base on these findings, I recommend targeted product manufacturing schedules and real-time inventory tracking to boost operational efficiency.

## Project 3: [Manufacturing Downtime Analysis](https://github.com/jacobdbt2100/Manufacturing-Downtime-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)

I analysed soda bottling production line data and found that downtime caused 36% inefficiency, extending batch duration by 23 hours. Operator errors were the leading drivers. Five factors–mainly machine adjustments, machine failure, and inventory shortage amongst others–accounted for 80% of total downtime. Base on these findings, I recommended targeted operator training, improved maintenance schedules, real-time inventory tracking, and high-downtime equipment upgrades to boost operational efficiency.
